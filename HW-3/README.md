I generated a Cartoon Green Pepper for the assignment but choose not to use it. I used Firefly and couldnt figure out how to make a transperent background. I did some research and it was suggested to put it into Adobe Express and remove it but at This time I didn't feel it would add much to the work. Eventually I could see adding these elments in and having the pizza cutter chase the cartoon charecter around and add them to the pizza. I like some AI generated photos and cartoons but choose to use Adobe Stock for now, Which said they were not AI.
