# MART220homework HW2
 
 I have attatched the AI Sketch for comparison. I put the old code from last assignment into the chatGPT box and ask it to do  your first 5 question on the assignment for the week. It spit out the same design with limited updates. 
 
 I decided to go with a pizza-making simulator where the user can add or remove pepperoni and cheese sprinkles either randomly or dynamically.
Â The pepperoni can be added dynamically by left-clicking the mouse button. It can also be done randomly using the right-click budding, but it is not as aesthetic as I would have liked it to be. The cheese starts out static; it can be placed by right-clicking with the pepperoni, and you can add more by scrolling up on the mouse wheel. Scrolling down removes all the toppings. Eventually, I would have liked to have added more toppings. 
In comparison, the ramen that ChatGPT made was pretty static. The noodles had subtle motion; each time you clicked the mou, pressing the key on the keyboard caused an interactive color change in the bowl. The ramen had fixed ingredients and chopsticks. It was esthetically organized well, in my opinion.
Both projects used the P5. JS Features like interactivity randomness and text rendering I believe my pizza piece is more user-driven, which allows players to change the design and have more interactivity with the object well chat GPT's ramen piece may have been more aesthetically pleasing with the static, subtle motion rather than the complete customization. I would have liked to have seen them be able to use the chopsticks to get the noodles more or something like that, which I suppose if I prompted the chatbot to do that, it probably could. I felt the ramen was a bit stiff compared to the pizza, but it may have been " prettier" than mine. I had fun making a pizza instead of just watching ramen noodles twitch.
