# MART220homework HW2
 
 I have attatched the AI Sketch for comparison. I put the old code from last assignment into the chatGPT box and ask it to do  your first 5 question on the assignment for the week. It spit out the same design with limited updates. 
 
 Both projects effectively use p5.js features like interactivity, randomness, and text rendering. However, my pizza piece is more user-driven, allowing players tochange the design, while ChatGPTâ€™s ramen piece is more static focusing on subtle motion rather than full customization. Only the noodle move on mouse click and bowl changes color on keypress, not really that exciting!

I enjoyed designing an interactive pizza it felt engaging and allowed me more control with the Pizzas The Ramen lick the chopstick and such,could use some more movement, which I'm guessing could be prompted into the chat to do so thuogh I feel the output would be a bit lifeless still. I kept my contols on the mouse while AI used keyboard and mouse.
